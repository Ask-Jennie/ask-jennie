# Deleting Angular Automation Module

Author of a Automation module can delete the module for server. Once the command is executed the module and all its files from server is deleted.

To do so just type below command from any location.

```
jennie angular Automation delete <automation-name>
```

Once the component is deleted there is no way to recover the Automation info. Make sure you have the backup for Automation before deleting it from server.
